I'm getting this problem:
...
Error: Found errors in the action dictionary of the '_glue' operation:
- Semantic action '_iter' has the wrong arity: expected 1, got 0

where my semantic action is:

...
    _iter: function (...children) { return children.map (c => c._glue ()); },
    _terminal: function () { return this.primitiveValue; }
};

This might be due to my error (very likely), but I don't see what is wrong.  I thought I'd ask before taking the time to build up a proper example...
